# Research: Joy Content Calendar System Updates

## Overview
Research findings for updating and enhancing the Joy content calendar management system.

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Decision: Laravel 11 with Livewire 3
**Rationale**: Existing system already built on Laravel 11 with Livewire for reactive components
**Alternatives considered**: Complete rewrite with Vue.js/React, but existing architecture is solid and well-tested

### Decision: Filament Admin Panel
**Rationale**: Currently in use for admin functionality, provides robust CRUD operations and dashboard capabilities
**Alternatives considered**: Custom admin panel, but Filament provides excellent developer experience and maintenance

### Decision: Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Rationale**: Already integrated and provides utility-first approach suitable for component-based architecture
**Alternatives considered**: Bootstrap, custom CSS - but existing Tailwind implementation is mature

## Architecture Analysis

### Decision: Service-Oriented Architecture
**Rationale**: System already has 8 dedicated services following Clean Code principles, proven effective
**Alternatives considered**: Monolithic controller approach, but services provide better separation of concerns

### Decision: MySQL/PostgreSQL with Eloquent ORM
**Rationale**: Laravel's Eloquent provides excellent developer experience with existing schema
**Alternatives considered**: NoSQL solutions, but relational structure fits content calendar requirements well

## Integration Requirements

### Decision: Trello API Integration
**Rationale**: Already implemented for comment synchronization, critical for agency workflow
**Alternatives considered**: Alternative project management tools, but Trello integration is established

### Decision: Slack Notifications
**Rationale**: Currently integrated via Trello for team notifications
**Alternatives considered**: Direct Slack integration, Teams, but current flow works effectively

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Magic Link Token System
**Rationale**: Provides secure client access without requiring account creation, core to business model
**Alternatives considered**: Traditional login system, OAuth, but magic links eliminate friction for clients

### Decision: Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Rationale**: Already implemented with AuditLog model, essential for compliance and debugging
**Alternatives considered**: Minimal logging, but full audit trail provides business value

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: PHPUnit with Feature Tests
**Rationale**: 127+ existing unit tests provide solid foundation, Laravel testing tools are mature
**Alternatives considered**: Pest PHP, but PHPUnit is well-established in the codebase

### Decision: PHPStan Static Analysis
**Rationale**: Already integrated for type safety and code quality
**Alternatives considered**: Psalm, but PHPStan is already configured and working

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Standard Web Application Performance
**Rationale**: Content calendar doesn't require real-time performance, standard caching strategies sufficient
**Alternatives considered**: Real-time updates with WebSockets, but current Livewire approach handles updates well

### Decision: Database Query Optimization
**Rationale**: Multi-tenant architecture requires careful N+1 prevention and proper indexing
**Alternatives considered**: Database sharding, but current scale doesn't warrant complexity

## Development Workflow

### Decision: Git Feature Branch Strategy
**Rationale**: Supports collaborative development and code review process
**Alternatives considered**: Trunk-based development, but feature branches provide better isolation

### Decision: Laravel Migration System
**Rationale**: Provides version control for database schema changes, essential for team development
**Alternatives considered**: Manual database changes, but migrations ensure consistency

## Unknowns Resolved
All technical context items have been clarified based on existing system architecture. No remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION items.

## Recommendations for Updates

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Expand integration test coverage for external API interactions
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Laravel Telescope for development debugging
3. **Security Hardening**: Review magic link expiration policies and token generation
4. **Code Quality**: Maintain PHPStan level 5+ analysis
5. **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md updated with architectural changes
