## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Agency users need to efficiently manage content calendars with improved workflows, while clients require seamless access to review and approve content through secure magic links. The system should provide enhanced visibility, better integration capabilities, and streamlined administration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an agency user is managing content, **When** they create a content item with multiple platform content_items, **Then** the system tracks each content_item independently with proper workflow states
2. **Given** a client receives a magic link, **When** they access the calendar view, **Then** they can see all their scheduled content with clear visual indicators for status and platform
3. **Given** there is a trello integration, **when** a client wants to provide feedback, **When** they comment on a content item, **Then** the comment syncs to the associated Trello card and triggers appropriate notifications
4. **Given** an admin is monitoring system activity, **When** they access the audit dashboard, **Then** they can view comprehensive logs of all user actions and system events

### Edge Cases
- What happens when magic links expire during active client sessions?
- How does system handle concurrent comments on the same content item?
- What occurs when Trello integration becomes unavailable during comment sync?
