# Feature Specification: Enhanced Statusfaction for Account Managers

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-have-the`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "we have the beginnings of 'statusfaction' for account managers. Account Managers have the same access as Agency but they should also have access to the Statusfaction link.  The form fields are correct, but the list of clients to give status needs to be update to show the client name, the status ('Needs Status','Pending Approval','Status Approved'). Admins have the ability to approve a status. Admins need to be able to read the most recent status and approve it. When Account Managers and Admins click into a status, they should see a graph that shows the last 5 weeks ratings for client satisfaction and team health."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature enhances existing Statusfaction system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Account Managers, Admins
   ‚Üí Actions: Submit status, approve status, view trends
   ‚Üí Data: Client satisfaction ratings, team health ratings
   ‚Üí Constraints: 5-week historical view
3. Clarifications resolved:
   ‚Üí Data older than 5 weeks is stored but not displayed
   ‚Üí Account Managers can edit statuses until approved
   ‚Üí Status triggers weekly on Sundays, typically submitted Thursdays
4. User Scenarios & Testing section complete
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for both roles
5. Functional Requirements complete
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Key Entities identified
   ‚Üí Statusfaction submission, approval workflow
7. Review Checklist passed
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: When an Account Manager views client data outside of Statusfaction, what access should they have? ‚Üí A: Full read/write access to all client data (calendar, content, etc.) like Agency users
- Q: When displaying the "last 5 weeks of ratings" in the trend graph, which 5 weeks should be shown? ‚Üí A: The 5 most recent weeks ending with the current week, showing gaps for missing submissions
- Q: Besides client satisfaction (1-10) and team health (1-10) ratings, what other fields should be included in the status submission form? ‚Üí A: Ratings plus required text notes field
- Q: When an Admin clicks into a client that has "Needs Status" (no submission yet for current week), what should they see? ‚Üí A: The 5-week trend graph with only previous weeks' data (current week empty)
- Q: What validation constraints should apply to the required notes field in status submissions? ‚Üí A: No minimum length; any non-empty text accepted

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As an** Account Manager
**I want to** submit weekly status reports for my assigned clients and view historical trends
**So that** I can track client satisfaction and team health over time and communicate status to leadership

**As an** Admin
**I want to** review and approve status submissions from Account Managers
**So that** I can ensure quality and accuracy before status is finalized

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Account Manager Scenarios:**

1. **Given** I am an Account Manager logged into the system
   **When** I navigate to the Statusfaction section
   **Then** I should see a list of my assigned clients with their current status state ('Needs Status', 'Pending Approval', 'Status Approved')

2. **Given** I have submitted a status for a client
   **When** I click into that status
   **Then** I should see a line graph showing the last 5 weeks of client satisfaction and team health ratings on the same graph

3. **Given** I am viewing a client that 'Needs Status'
   **When** I submit the status form with client satisfaction (1-10) and team health (1-10) ratings plus required notes
   **Then** the client status should change to 'Pending Approval'

4. **Given** I have a status in 'Pending Approval' state
   **When** I edit the ratings or notes
   **Then** the system should save my changes and maintain 'Pending Approval' status

5. **Given** I am submitting a status form
   **When** I attempt to submit without entering notes
   **Then** the system should prevent submission and require notes to be entered

6. **Given** my status has been approved
   **When** I attempt to edit it
   **Then** the system should prevent editing of approved statuses

**Admin Scenarios:**

1. **Given** I am an Admin logged into the system
   **When** I navigate to the Statusfaction section
   **Then** I should see all clients across all Account Managers with their status states

2. **Given** a status is in 'Pending Approval' state
   **When** I click to view the status details
   **Then** I should see the submitted ratings, notes, and have the ability to approve

3. **Given** I am viewing a status in 'Pending Approval'
   **When** I approve the status
   **Then** the status should change to 'Status Approved'

4. **Given** I click into any client's status (regardless of state)
   **When** I view the status details
   **Then** I should see the same 5-week trend line graph showing both client satisfaction and team health ratings

5. **Given** I click into a client with 'Needs Status' state
   **When** I view the details
   **Then** I should see the 5-week trend graph showing only previous weeks' data (current week shows as empty/gap)

### Edge Cases

- **No Clients Assigned**: When an Account Manager has no clients assigned, no status reports are needed (empty state shown)
- **Pending Approval**: If a status is never approved, it remains in 'Pending Approval' state indefinitely
- **Admin/Account Manager Overlap**: Admins can approve statuses (no Account Managers hold Admin role)
- **Limited Historical Data**: When less than 5 weeks of data exists, show only the available weeks with gaps for missing submissions
- **Missing Submissions**: Trend graph displays gaps (null data points) for weeks where no status was submitted within the 5-week window
- **Needs Status Detail View**: Clicking into a client with 'Needs Status' state shows the trend graph with historical data; current week appears as empty/gap
- **One Status Per Week**: Only one status can be submitted per client per week
- **Client Reassignment**: Client reassignment mid-week does not affect existing status workflow
- **Weekly Cycle**: New status period triggers on Sundays; statuses typically submitted on Thursdays
