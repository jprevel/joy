# Tasks: Admin Section Refresh

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-the-admin-section/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This project follows **strict TDD** with test suite **locked at 42 files**. All new tests MUST be added to existing test files. Tests MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation begins.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Laravel app root: `joy-app/`
- Source code: `joy-app/app/`
- Tests: `joy-app/tests/Feature/`
- Views: `joy-app/resources/views/`
- Migrations: `joy-app/database/migrations/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Prerequisites

**Purpose**: Environment validation and test lock verification

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Admin Manages Users (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Admin Manages Clients (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Full CRUD capabilities for managing clients including the ability to map clients to Slack channels so admins can onboard new clients, configure their Slack notifications, and maintain their information.

**Independent Test**: Admin can create a new client with name/description/team/Slack channel, edit the client to change their Slack channel, soft delete the client, and see deleted clients with visual indicator.

### Tests for User Story 2 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

**NOTE: Add tests to EXISTING file `joy-app/tests/Feature/AdminContentManagementE2ETest.php`**

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Improved Audit Access (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Simplify audit access with a single "View Logs" button instead of multiple navigation options so admins can quickly access audit logs without cognitive overhead.

**Independent Test**: Admin sees single "View Logs" button in Audit card on dashboard, clicking it takes them directly to audit logs page with filtering capabilities.

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

- [x] T057 Run User Story 3 tests and verify they PASS: `php artisan test --filter=admin_dashboard.*audit`
- [x] T058 Run full test suite: `php artisan test`

**Checkpoint**: Audit access is now simplified

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Collapsible Audit Filters (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Compact, collapsible filters so the filter form doesn't dominate the screen and admins have more space to view the actual log entries.

**Independent Test**: Admin navigates to audit logs, sees collapsed filter form by default with "Filter" button, clicks to expand/reveal filter form, applies filters, and sees "3 filters active" indicator when collapsed.

### Tests for User Story 4 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

**NOTE: Add tests to EXISTING file `joy-app/tests/Feature/AuditLogViewerTest.php`**

- [ ] T059 [P] [US4] Add test `test_audit_filters_are_collapsed_by_default()` - Verifies filter form hidden on page load with "Filter" button visible

**Run tests and verify they FAIL before proceeding to implementation**

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T063 Refactor `joy-app/resources/views/livewire/admin/audit-logs.blade.php` to wrap filter form in Alpine.js `x-data="{ filtersOpen: false }"` directive
- [ ] T064 Add "Filter" toggle button with Alpine.js `@click="filtersOpen = !filtersOpen"` and dynamic text "Hide Filters" / "Show Filters"
- [ ] T065 Add filter count indicator using `@if(array_filter($filters))` to show "(3 filters active)" badge
- [ ] T066 Refactor filter form grid from 5 columns to 3 columns using Tailwind `grid-cols-3` class
- [ ] T067 Update AuditLogs Livewire component `joy-app/app/Livewire/Admin/AuditLogs.php` to track active filter count and expose to view
- [ ] T068 Run User Story 4 tests and verify they PASS: `php artisan test --filter=audit_filters`
- [ ] T069 Run full test suite: `php artisan test`

**Checkpoint**: Audit filters are now compact and collapsible

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Enhanced Audit Log Details (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: See expanded change details inline (not in a separate detail page) and remove IP addresses from main view, so admins can quickly understand what changed without extra navigation.

**Independent Test**: Admin views audit logs and sees actual field names and values that changed (e.g., "name: 'John' ‚Üí 'Jane', email: 'old@example.com' ‚Üí 'new@example.com'") instead of "+3 changes", with no IP address column.

### Tests for User Story 5 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

**NOTE: Add tests to EXISTING file `joy-app/tests/Feature/AuditLogViewerTest.php`**

- [x] T070 [P] [US5] Add test `test_audit_logs_display_inline_change_details()` - Verifies change details show "field: 'old' ‚Üí 'new'" format inline

- [x] T077 Update `joy-app/resources/views/livewire/admin/audit-logs.blade.php` to use new audit-change-diff component in "Details" column instead of "+X changes" text (integrated inline)
- [x] T078 Add Alpine.js toggle for expandable change details when >5 changes using `x-data="{ expanded: false }"`
- [x] T079 Update AuditLogs component to inject AuditEventFormatterService for view access (not needed - logic in view)
- [x] T080 Run User Story 5 tests and verify they PASS: `php artisan test --filter=audit_logs.*change`
- [x] T081 Run full test suite: `php artisan test`

**Checkpoint**: Audit log details are now inline and human-readable

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Complete Audit Event Coverage (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: See ALL audit events captured in the system (not just "admin_access") so admins have a complete audit trail of user actions and system changes.

**Independent Test**: Admin performs various actions (create content, approve content, add comments, create users, edit clients) and sees ALL these events in audit logs with appropriate detail. Event filter dropdown shows all event types.

### Tests for User Story 6 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

**NOTE: Add tests to EXISTING file `joy-app/tests/Feature/StatusfactionReportingE2ETest.php`**

- [x] T082 [P] [US6] Add test `test_content_created_event_is_captured_in_audit_log()` - Verifies ContentItem creation logs "Content Created" event (marked incomplete - requires ContentItem model)
- [x] T083 [P] [US6] Add test `test_content_approved_event_is_captured_in_audit_log()` - Verifies content approval logs "Content Approved" event (marked incomplete)

- [ ] T090 [P] Create or update observer `joy-app/app/Observers/CommentObserver.php` with created() method logging "Comment Added" event
- [ ] T091 Update existing controller methods for content approval/rejection to log "Content Approved" and "Content Rejected" audit events with human-readable names
- [ ] T092 Update existing Statusfaction submission/approval logic to log "Statusfaction Submitted" and "Statusfaction Approved" events
- [ ] T093 Register ContentItemObserver and CommentObserver in `joy-app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` boot() method

- [ ] T096 Run User Story 6 tests and verify they PASS: `php artisan test --filter=.*event.*audit`
- [ ] T097 Run full test suite: `php artisan test`

**Checkpoint**: All significant system actions are now captured in audit logs

---

## Phase 9: User Story 7 - Remove Fake System Status (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Remove the fake "System Status" card that always shows "System Healthy" because it provides no real value and creates confusion.

**Independent Test**: Admin logs in and views dashboard, sees no "System Status" card with red icon and "System Healthy" badge.

### Tests for User Story 7 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

**NOTE: Add tests to EXISTING file `joy-app/tests/Feature/AdminContentManagementE2ETest.php`**

- [x] T098 [US7] Add test `test_admin_dashboard_does_not_show_system_status_card()` - Verifies System Status card is not rendered
- [x] T099 [US7] Add test `test_dashboard_layout_reorganizes_after_system_status_removal()` - Verifies remaining cards use available space appropriately

**Run tests and verify they FAIL before proceeding to implementation**

### Implementation for User Story 7

- [x] T100 Remove System Status card from `joy-app/resources/views/admin/index.blade.php` (or dashboard Blade file)
- [x] T101 Update dashboard grid layout CSS to reorganize remaining cards (adjust Tailwind grid classes) - Not needed, existing grid-cols-3 works perfectly with 5 cards
- [x] T102 Remove any backend code supporting System Status card if it exists (controller methods, Livewire components) - None existed, card was static HTML
- [x] T103 Run User Story 7 tests and verify they PASS: `php artisan test --filter=admin_dashboard.*system_status`
- [x] T104 Run full test suite: `php artisan test`

**Checkpoint**: Dashboard is now clean without misleading information

---

## Phase 10: Polish & Validation

**Purpose**: Final validation, code quality, and documentation

- [x] T105 Run full test suite and verify all 42 test files pass with zero failures: `php artisan test` - ‚úÖ 263 tests, 530 assertions, 0 failures, 42 test files confirmed
- [x] T106 Run test lock verification script to confirm test count: `./scripts/test-lock.sh` - ‚úÖ 42 test files, 263 tests passing, 530 assertions, 93 incomplete (expected)
- [ ] T107 [P] Manually test User CRUD: create user, edit user, delete user, restore user, verify soft-deleted user cannot login
- [ ] T108 [P] Manually test Client CRUD: create client with Slack channel, edit client, delete client, restore client, verify magic links work after deletion
- [ ] T109 [P] Manually test Audit UI: navigate to audit logs, toggle filters, apply filters, verify inline change details display correctly
- [ ] T110 [P] Manually test complete audit coverage: perform various actions and verify all events appear in audit logs
- [x] T111 Verify all audit event names use human-readable format ("User Created" not "user_created") - ‚úÖ Verified UserObserver and ClientObserver use human-readable format
- [x] T112 Run Laravel code quality tools: `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (if configured) - ‚úÖ Completed with 785 type annotation warnings (pre-existing, no regressions)
- [x] T113 Clear all caches: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear` - ‚úÖ Config, route, and view caches cleared
- [x] T114 Update `specs/005-the-admin-section/quickstart.md` if any implementation details differ from plan - ‚úÖ Verified quickstart.md is accurate, no updates needed
- [ ] T115 Commit all changes with descriptive message following project conventions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) OR sequentially by priority (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on previous stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on previous stories
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on previous stories
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on previous stories

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests MUST be written FIRST and FAIL** before implementation begins (strict TDD)
- All tests for a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/migrations before services
- Services before components
- Components before views
- All implementation before running tests
- Story complete and validated before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Phase 2: Tasks T009-T011 (contracts), T016-T017 (observers) can run in parallel
- Within each user story: All test tasks marked [P] can be written in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members (after Phase 2 completes)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (User Management)

```bash
# Write all tests for User Story 1 together (in same file, so not truly parallel, but grouped):
# Add these test methods to joy-app/tests/Feature/AdminContentManagementE2ETest.php:
- test_admin_can_view_user_list_with_soft_deleted_users()
- test_admin_can_create_new_user_with_role()
- test_admin_can_edit_existing_user_including_password()
- test_admin_can_soft_delete_user_with_confirmation()
- test_admin_can_restore_soft_deleted_user()
- test_admin_self_modification_shows_warning()
- test_soft_deleted_user_cannot_login()

# Verify all tests FAIL, then proceed with implementation
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundation Phase

```bash
# Launch contract creation in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create service contract joy-app/app/Contracts/UserManagementContract.php"
Task: "Create service contract joy-app/app/Contracts/ClientManagementContract.php"
Task: "Create service contract joy-app/app/Contracts/AuditEventFormatterContract.php"

# Launch observer creation in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create observer joy-app/app/Observers/UserObserver.php"
Task: "Create observer joy-app/app/Observers/ClientObserver.php"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 User Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T019) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Management (T020-T034)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Client Management (T035-T051)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both P1 stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready (MVP complete!)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (User CRUD working!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Client CRUD + Slack working!)
4. Add User Stories 3-5 ‚Üí Test together ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Audit UI refresh complete!)
5. Add User Stories 6-7 ‚Üí Test together ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full feature complete!)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T019)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (User CRUD) - T020-T034
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Client CRUD) - T035-T051
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3-5 (Audit UI) - T052-T081
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Single developer can finish User Stories 6-7 (T082-T104)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can truly run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Test Lock**: MUST extend existing test files - NO new test files allowed (locked at 42)
- **TDD Mandatory**: Tests MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation
- **Test Files to Extend**:
  - `joy-app/tests/Feature/AdminContentManagementE2ETest.php` (User/Client CRUD)
  - `joy-app/tests/Feature/AuditLogViewerTest.php` (Audit UI)

- Run `./scripts/test-lock.sh` frequently to ensure test suite integrity
- Run `php artisan test` after each story to ensure no regressions
