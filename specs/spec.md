## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Agency users need to efficiently manage content calendars with improved workflows, while clients require seamless access to review and approve content through secure magic links. The system should provide enhanced visibility, better integration capabilities, and streamlined administration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an agency user is managing content, **When** they create a content item with multiple platform variants, **Then** the system tracks each variant independently with proper workflow states
2. **Given** a client receives a magic link, **When** they access the calendar view, **Then** they can see all scheduled content with clear visual indicators for status and platform
3. **Given** a client wants to provide feedback, **When** they comment on a content item, **Then** the comment syncs to the associated Trello card and triggers appropriate notifications
4. **Given** an admin is monitoring system activity, **When** they access the audit dashboard, **Then** they can view comprehensive logs of all user actions and system events
5. **Given** an admin needs to review recent system activity, **When** they access the audit log viewer, **Then** they can view the last 100 audit log entries with timestamps, user information, and action details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when magic links expire during active client sessions?
- How does system handle concurrent comments on the same content item?
- What occurs when Trello integration becomes unavailable during comment sync?
- When there are fewer than 100 audit log entries, system displays all available entries
- When no audit logs match filter criteria or database is empty, system displays empty state with clear messaging
